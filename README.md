# RetroSpotter

* A computational pipeline for measuring the expression of Endogenous Retroviruses using publically available RNA Seq Data.

* This project originally started as an attempt to measure structural variant expression in RNA Sequencing data. 


## What is RetroSpotter?

The human genome has many Endogenous Retroviruses. It was been proposed that these Endogenous Retroviruses play a role in disease It would be great if we could analyse how the expression of these genetic elements differ in disease. RetroSpotter is a computational pipeline for achieving this.


We have tested RetroSpotter comparing AML and a Geuvadis dataset.


## How to use RetroSpotter ?
