# Differential Expression of Copy Number Variation (CNVS) from RNA Seq

* Finding gene duplications in RNA Seq is normally not possible. However certain duplications are associated with particular SNPs.

* We can look for these SNPs in RNA Seq data and therefore find the duplications.




## What's the problem ?


Copy Number Variations (CNVs) are the cause of a number of human disease. Any tool which aids the discovery of CNVs would be of great use.


## What is INSERT NAME ?



## How to use INSERT NAME ?



## Draft Pipeline

* Use SNPs and RNA Seq data to find possible duplications.

* Input: data from SRA and gene name

* Output: Diffential expression plots
