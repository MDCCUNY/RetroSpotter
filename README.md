# Differential Expression of Copy Number Variation (CNVS) from RNA Seq

Using data from the SRA to look for CNVs in RNASeq Data.

Use the fact that certain SNPS are associated with a particilar duplication.

Look at the proportion of reads with a SNP and without SNP.

Hopefully this will allow us to detect and look at the expression of this CNV.


## Draft Pipeline

* Use SNPs and RNA Seq data to find possible duplications.

* Input: data from SRA and gene name

* Output: Diffential expression plots

## To Do:

* Decide on dataset(s) and collect data.
* Download and setup any needed tools.
* Code!
* Make plots.
* Test
